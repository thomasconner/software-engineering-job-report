# Architecture

The contracts here are shared by every module. Change them here first, then in code.

## Layout

```
src/sejr/
  cli.py            `sejr <command>` entry point (fetch, normalize, features, classify, aggregate, export)
  fetch.py          Algolia → data/raw
  normalize.py      data/raw → DuckDB threads/posts/replies
  features/         deterministic answers (regex, vocab, joins) → answers table
  classify/         Jev questions → answers table
  aggregate.py      answers → monthly_metrics, point-in-time
  export.py         monthly_metrics → site/data/*.json
data/raw/           gzipped API responses, committed, never edited
data/sejr.duckdb    rebuildable from data/raw, gitignored
data/cache/jev/     cached Jev responses keyed by request hash, gitignored
data/answers/       Jev answers as Parquet, committed (the durable record)
site/               static GitHub Pages site (index.html + assets + data/)
site/articles/      one Markdown article per month, YYYY-MM.md
tests/
```

Run everything with `uv run sejr <command>`. Tests: `uv run pytest`.

## Raw storage

`data/raw/<kind>/<YYYY-MM>/<thread_id>.json.gz`: the Algolia `items/<id>` response, unmodified, plus a sidecar `<thread_id>.meta.json` with `{thread_id, kind, month, title, fetched_at, source_url}`.

`kind` is one of `hiring` ("Ask HN: Who is hiring?") or `seeking` ("Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?"). Freelancer threads are ignored.

`month` is the month named in the title, not the creation date.

One file per thread; a re-fetch overwrites it only when content changed, and git history keeps earlier versions. The sidecar also records `checked_at` (last fetch, changed or not) and the thread's Firebase `kids` list, used to count removed posts.

## DuckDB schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE threads (
  thread_id   BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  kind        VARCHAR NOT NULL,          -- 'hiring' | 'seeking'
  month       DATE NOT NULL,             -- first day of the named month
  title       VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  snapshot_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,      -- created_at + 168 hours (computed in UTC)
  fetched_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,      -- last fetch whose content was stored or confirmed unchanged
  removed_in_snapshot INTEGER,           -- top-level comments (Firebase kids) in the window that Algolia omits as deleted/dead
  UNIQUE (kind, month)
);

CREATE TABLE posts (                      -- top-level comments only
  post_id     BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id   BIGINT NOT NULL,
  author      VARCHAR,
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  text_html   VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  text        VARCHAR NOT NULL,          -- HTML stripped, entities decoded, paragraphs as \n\n
  in_snapshot BOOLEAN NOT NULL           -- created_at <= threads.snapshot_at
);

CREATE TABLE replies (                    -- every non-top-level comment
  reply_id    BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id     BIGINT NOT NULL,           -- top-level ancestor
  parent_id   BIGINT NOT NULL,
  thread_id   BIGINT NOT NULL,
  author      VARCHAR,
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  text        VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  depth       INTEGER NOT NULL,          -- 1 = direct reply to a post
  in_snapshot BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE answers (
  post_id       BIGINT NOT NULL,
  question      VARCHAR NOT NULL,        -- e.g. 'work_mode', 'salary_min_usd', 'mentions_visa'
  method        VARCHAR NOT NULL,        -- 'regex' | 'vocab' | 'join' | 'jev'
  version       VARCHAR NOT NULL,        -- code version for deterministic, model id for jev (e.g. 'jev-1.14.0')
  value         DOUBLE,                  -- numeric answer, Noul probability, or Score position
  label         VARCHAR,                 -- categorical answer (top choice)
  probabilities JSON,                    -- full distribution for Choice/Score
  confidence    DOUBLE,
  PRIMARY KEY (post_id, question, method, version)
);

CREATE TABLE monthly_metrics (
  month    DATE NOT NULL,
  kind     VARCHAR NOT NULL,             -- thread kind the metric is about
  metric   VARCHAR NOT NULL,             -- metric id, see below
  category VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT '',  -- '' for scalar metrics, the category for breakdowns
  value    DOUBLE,
  n        INTEGER,                      -- posts the value is based on
  PRIMARY KEY (month, kind, metric, category)
);
```

Empty-text, `[dead]` and `[flagged]` comments are dropped in normalize, and the count is logged.

## Point-in-time rule

Every metric for month *t* may read only:

- posts and replies with `in_snapshot = true` from threads with `month <= t`;
- answers for those posts.

A month is complete only when its thread's `fetched_at >= snapshot_at`. Aggregate skips incomplete months (the export lists them as `pending`).

Raw files freeze once complete: fetch re-fetches a thread only while its stored `fetched_at < snapshot_at`. Later edits and deletions never change a published month.

`aggregate.compute_month(con, t)` must return the same rows whether the database holds all months or only months `<= t`. `tests/test_point_in_time.py` enforces this.

## Metric ids

Scalar metrics (`category = ''`). Shares are 0–1. Jev-based shares are expected values (sums of probabilities divided by n).

| metric | kind | method | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `posts` | hiring, seeking | count | top-level posts in snapshot |
| `removed_share` | hiring, seeking | count | removed_in_snapshot ÷ (posts + removed_in_snapshot); shown in methodology |
| `seekers_per_post` | hiring | count | seeking posts ÷ hiring posts, same month |
| `replies_per_post` | hiring | count | mean direct replies per post |
| `salary_disclosed_share` | hiring | regex | share with a parseable salary |
| `salary_min_median_usd` | hiring | regex | median lower bound, USD annual, among disclosed |
| `salary_max_median_usd` | hiring | regex | median upper bound |
| `remote_token_share` | hiring | regex | REMOTE in the header line |
| `onsite_token_share` | hiring | regex | ONSITE in the header line |
| `visa_share` | hiring | regex | mentions visa sponsorship |
| `new_company_share` | hiring | join | company not seen in any earlier month |
| `returning_company_share` | hiring | join | company also posted last month |
| `ai_native_share` | hiring | jev | Noul: the post describes its product as built on AI/ML |
| `new_grad_share` | hiring | jev | Noul: open to new grads / juniors |
| `seeker_mood` | seeking | jev | Score mean, 0 (discouraged) – 4 (upbeat) |
| `seeker_strained_share` | seeking | jev | mean of P(level 0) + P(level 1) of seeker_mood |
| `eng_leadership_share` | hiring | jev | Noul: the post hires engineering managers or leads |
| `interns_token_share` | hiring | regex | INTERN(S) keyword present |

Breakdowns (`category` set, values sum to ~1 per month):

| metric | method | categories |
|---|---|---|
| `work_mode` | jev | remote, hybrid, onsite, unclear |
| `seniority` | jev | junior, mid, senior, staff_plus, unspecified. The modal level of the individual-contributor engineering roles; management roles excluded; "all levels" = unspecified |
| `industry` | jev | ai_ml, devtools_infra, fintech, health, climate_energy, security, commerce, media_consumer, enterprise_saas, hardware_robotics, other, unstated. `other` = described but no listed sector fits; `unstated` = the post doesn't say what the company does. Export also publishes shares renormalized over posts whose sector is known |
| `funding_stage` | jev | bootstrapped, seed, series_a, series_b, series_c_plus, public_or_large, venture_unspecified, unknown. `seed` needs an explicitly named pre-seed/seed/angel round; an accelerator batch tag alone (e.g. "YC W12") is `unknown`; investors or amounts without a named round are `venture_unspecified` |
| `stack` | vocab | one category per term in `features/vocab.py`; share of posts mentioning it (does not sum to 1) |

## Export contract: `site/data/metrics.json`

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-11-09T12:00:00Z",
  "latest_month": "2026-11",
  "months": ["2011-04", "...", "2026-11"],
  "metrics": {
    "posts.hiring": {
      "label": "Companies hiring",
      "unit": "count",
      "method": "count",
      "description": "Top-level posts in the first 7 days of the thread",
      "series": [{"month": "2026-11", "value": 312, "n": 312}]
    }
  },
  "breakdowns": {
    "work_mode": {
      "label": "How companies want people to work",
      "method": "jev",
      "categories": ["remote", "hybrid", "onsite", "unclear"],
      "series": [{"month": "2026-11", "n": 312, "values": {"remote": 0.41, "hybrid": 0.22, "onsite": 0.31, "unclear": 0.06}}]
    }
  }
}
```

Scalar keys are `<metric>.<kind>`. Each metric and breakdown carries `polarity`: `1` when a rise is good news for job seekers, `-1` when bad, `0` when neutral; the exporter owns it. `pending` lists months whose snapshot is not complete; the site never shows a pending month (series end at the last complete month, and the newest article is for that month). Each metric and breakdown also carries `sources`: the thread kinds it draws on (e.g. `["hiring","seeking"]` for `seekers_per_post`), used for the chart source line. `n` is the number of posts the value is computed from (for salary medians: posts with a parsed salary). The mock file adds `"mock": true` and `"note"`. `unit` is one of `count`, `share`, `usd`, `ratio`, `score`. Months with no data are omitted from `series`, never null-filled.

## Articles: `site/articles/YYYY-MM.md`

Markdown with front matter and chart directives. The site renders the newest article by default, with a month picker for older ones.

```markdown
---
month: 2026-11
headline: "Remote work is losing, but not where you'd think"
dek: "One-sentence standfirst under the headline."
byline: "Software Engineering Job Report"
---

Body paragraphs…

::chart{type="line" metric="posts.hiring" from="2019-01" annotate="2022-11:ChatGPT launches"}

::chart{type="stacked-area" breakdown="work_mode" from="2020-01"}

::compare{metrics="posts.hiring,seekers_per_post.hiring,salary_disclosed_share.hiring" against="3m,1y,5y"}
```

Chart types: `line`, `bar`, `stacked-area`, `small-multiples`, `slope` (two months compared), `dot` (now vs past per category).

Directive attributes:

| attribute | applies to | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `metric` | all charts | one metric key, or a comma list for multi-series lines |
| `breakdown` | stacked-area, small-multiples, slope, dot, bar | breakdown id |
| `categories` | breakdown charts | comma list; a subset of the breakdown's categories |
| `highlight` | multi-series charts | comma list of series drawn in the story color; the rest gray |
| `from`, `to` | time-series charts | YYYY-MM bounds of the default view |
| `vs` | slope, dot | the past point: `3m`, `1y`, `5y`, or `YYYY-MM`; default 5y on slope, 1y on dot |
| `months` | slope | two explicit months, `"2021-10,2026-10"`; overrides `vs` |
| `against` | ::compare | comma list of windows, default `3m,1y,5y` |
| `annotate` | time-series charts | `YYYY-MM:Label`, several separated by `;` |
| `title` | all, including ::compare | required; the finding, stated |
| `subtitle` | all | optional; defaults to the metric label + date range |
| `note` | all | text after the source line |

`bar` with a breakdown draws horizontal bars at the issue month; with a scalar metric it draws monthly columns (default: the last 24 months). `stack` must not be drawn as `stacked-area` (its shares don't sum to 1).

A back issue clips every series to its front-matter `month`, so older issues never show later data.

Manifest: `site/articles/index.json` is `{"months": ["YYYY-MM", ...]}`, newest last. Files starting with `_` are samples and never listed.

## Jev answers storage

- `industry` rows store the folded distribution: P(sector) = P(fits) × P(sector | Choice); P(other) and P(unstated) come from the companion Nouls. `confidence` is that of the stored label, or NULL.
- Noul rows have NULL `confidence`.
- `answers` holds one Jev version per post; classify replaces a post's Jev rows.
- Classify runs only on posts from complete threads, so answers reflect the text at freeze. Each stored answer set carries a request digest (sha256 of the request, text included); a post is re-sent only when its digest changes.
- Durable copy: `data/answers/<model>/<YYYY-MM>.parquet` (one file per thread month, both kinds). Classify loads these before calling the API, so a fresh checkout reclassifies nothing. The response cache under `data/cache/jev/` is a local accelerator, sharded by the first two hex characters of the hash, and gitignored.

## Validation set

`data/labels/reference.jsonl`: about 240 posts stratified by era (2011–14, 2015–19, 2020–22, 2023–26) and kind, labeled independently. Each Jev question reports accuracy and Brier score per era before its metric is published; the export carries those scores per metric as `validation`.

## Sample posts: `site/data/samples/YYYY-MM.json`

Real posts the article may quote, so the column never invents color. Export writes, for each complete month, a deterministic sample (seeded by month) of up to 30 in-snapshot hiring posts. Seeking posts are never exported:

```json
{"month": "2026-11", "posts": [{"id": 50340012, "kind": "hiring", "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=50340012", "header": "first line", "text": "first 600 characters", "answers": {"work_mode": "remote", "new_grad": 0.91}}]}
```

The writer may quote only from these files and must put the item id in the ledger. Individual job seekers are never quoted or paraphrased.

## Question ids in `answers`

| question | method | stored as |
|---|---|---|
| `company` | regex | label: normalized company name |
| `salary_min_usd`, `salary_max_usd` | regex | value |
| `salary_currency` | regex | label: ISO code, `unknown` (bare k-range), or `none` (no salary found) |
| `remote_token`, `onsite_token`, `mentions_visa`, `interns_token` | regex | value 0/1 |
| `stack` | vocab | one row per post; `probabilities` holds the terms found |
| `new_company`, `returned_from_last_month` | join | value 0/1; not emitted when no earlier (or previous-month) hiring thread exists |
| `work_mode`, `seniority`, `industry`, `funding_stage` | jev | Choice: label, probabilities (category → p), confidence |
| `industry_stated`, `industry_fits`, `ai_native`, `new_grad`, `eng_leadership` | jev | Noul: value |
| `seeker_mood` | jev | Score: value, probabilities keyed "0"–"4", confidence |

`salary_disclosed_share` counts any currency, including `unknown`; the salary medians use USD only.

Extra breakdowns: `industry_known` (sector shares among posts whose sector is stated), `seniority_ai_native` and `seniority_not_ai_native` (seniority shares among posts with ai_native ≥ 0.5 and < 0.5). Stack categories use display names ("C++", "Next.js", "AI agents").

Completeness is per thread: a month whose hiring thread is complete publishes hiring metrics even if its seeking thread is still pending; `seekers_per_post` needs both.

Samples contain hiring posts only. Seeking posts are never exported.

Authoring mode (`?mock=1`, localhost) shows directive errors in red; readers see "This chart is unavailable". Samples (`_name.md`) load only with `?mock=1&issue=_name`.

## Comparability and minimum n

- Each metric and breakdown may carry `comparable_from: "YYYY-MM"`. Points before it are not exported, and the description says why (e.g. `onsite_token_share` and `remote_token_share` from 2015-07, when the REMOTE/ONSITE header convention took hold; `new_company_share` from 2013-04, the first month with a full 24-month lookback).
- `new_company` means not seen in the prior 24 months (stationary), not "never seen".
- Points with `n` below `min_n` are omitted: 30 for salary medians, 50 for any share or breakdown.
- Jev-based metrics publish a month only when at least 98% of its in-snapshot posts are answered.
- Salary per post: the median of its ranges' lows and the median of their highs (not the extreme floor and ceiling across roles).
- `validation` per metric comes from `site/data/validation.json` (holdout scores preferred), null until scored.
- `generated_at` is the newest `fetched_at` among complete threads, so `metrics.json` changes only when data does.
